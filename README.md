# **Kotlin Sample - MVP Architecture**

![Image](img/banner.png)

This Project is mainly focused on implementing MVP Pattern in Android with Kotlin.

The repository contains simple Login screen and welcome screen with the following learnings.
    
* Kotlin
* MVP Architecture

Also, the MVP Architecture is inspired from [Mindorks MVP Android Architecture](https://github.com/MindorksOpenSource/android-mvp-architecture), but concentrates on demonstrating the architecture without introducing the third party libraries like Dependency Injection(Dagger) and RxJava.
